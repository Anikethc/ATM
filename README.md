# ATM

Hello Everyone! Welcome to my GitHub repo 'ATM'. I created an ATM program in Python.

## How to Use It?

This program is basically an ATM. You can deposit, withdraw, or check your current balance. When you download and run the program, you have to enter a PIN. The PIN is **8241** (shush...don't tell anyone).

After entering the PIN, you get options to withdraw money, deposit money, and check your balance.

## Can You Use It?

Yes, you can download this repo and use it for your own purposes.

You have the right to download, modify, and share it to others. But don't sell it to anyone.

## Issues & Bugs

If you encounter any issues or bugs, you can visit the 'Issues' tab in my repository and create an issue. I will immediately look into it and resolve as soon as possible.

## Any Doubts or Questions

If you have any doubts or questions, you are always free to ask me. I will be available on Twitter (twitter.com/anikethchavare) and Discord (AnikethC#6392).

## Conclusion

Thank you everyone, I hope you liked my repo!
